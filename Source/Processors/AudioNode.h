/**

  The default processor for sending output to the audio monitor.

  The ProcessorGraph has two default nodes: the AudioNode and the RecordNode.
  Every channel of every processor (that's not a sink or a utility) is automatically
  connected to both of these nodes. The AudioNode is used to filter out channels to be
  sent to the audio output device, which can be selected by the user through the AudioEditor
  (located in the ControlPanel).

  Since the AudioNode exists no matter what, it doesn't appear in the ProcessorList.
  Instead, it's created by the ProcessorGraph at startup.

  Each processor has an "Audio" tab within its channel-selector drawer that determines
  which channels will be monitored. At the moment's there's no centralized way to
  control the channels going to the audio monitor; it all happens in a distributed
  way through the individual processors.
