/**

  Allows subclasses to access important pointers within the application.

  When an object inherits from AccessClass, it makes it much more convenient to get and
  set pointers to other objects, such as the EditorViewport, ProcessorList, and
  ProcessorGraph that are used throughout the application. In addition, every subclass
  of AccessClass automatically adds the MessageCenter as an ActionListener, which means
  messages sent by that object [using sendActionMessage("Message.")] will appear
  in the MessageCenter by default.
